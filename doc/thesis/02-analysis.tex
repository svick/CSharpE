\chapter{Possible approaches}

The goal of this work is to create a system for extending the C\# language. It should be possible to use it create a wide variety of extensions, including:

\begin{itemize}
\item Extension similar to an F\# type providers.
\item Extension similar to a PostSharp aspects.
\item Extension for entity types, which can generate constructors, members required for comparison and any other common boilerplate code.
\item Extension that modifies how existing language feature operates, for example, improving the time complexity of recursive iterators from quadratic to linear.
\item Extension that can be used to write a single method that performs numeric computation with any numeric type. This is easy to achieve with C++ templates, but impossible with C\# generics, because they don't have a way of specifying operators required by the method.
\item Extension that optimizes LINQ to Objects queries into efficient imperative code.
\item Extension that converts an \ac{AoS} into \iac{SoA}, to improve performance of memory accesses in some cases.
\end{itemize}
